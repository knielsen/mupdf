=======================================================================
NOTE: This is Kristian Nielsen's branch of mupdf-gl with some extra
patches that add dual-page view, interactive search, proper
copy-paste, and more.

This branch mainly exists as a place to add patches for submission to
upstream MuPDF, and to share code for others that may be interested in
the enhancements until such time that they become available upstream.
Expect this branch to be periodically git-rebased on top of latest MuPDF code.

The MuPDF code as a whole, and therefore also this branch as a whole,
is under the GNU Affero General Public Licence, see original README
text below. In addition to this, the changes authored by me, Kristian
Nielsen <knielsen@knielsen-hq.org>, and those changes only, are also
released under a more liberal 3-clause BSD licence:

MuPDF uses a contributer licence agreement that gives the company
Artifex Software a more liberal licence to contributions than the AGPL
that MuPDF is available under. I want everyone to have similar rights
to my code, hence the use of the liberal BSD 3-clause licence for
the patches that I authored and hold the copyright for.

Below is the original README for upstream MuPDF:
